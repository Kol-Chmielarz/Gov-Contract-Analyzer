open postgres db
psql -U kol -d gov_contracts

\dt
SELECT * FROM contracts LIMIT _

To get contracts limited to 100, we can do random 100 of each page
API request failures from overload so limited on data I can fetch
I am fetching the 100 form each month for 2015-2024 so 1200 contracts for each year - about, duplicates cause issue. Randomizing page so there is less duplicate chance
It is the first 100 contracts from the month so if it is  skewed from that sorry but im going to assume for project purposes it is not
