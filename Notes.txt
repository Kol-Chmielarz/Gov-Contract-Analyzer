open postgres db
psql -U kol -d gov_contracts
\dt     list tables
SELECT * FROM contracts LIMIT 10;    view data
/Applications/pgAdmin\ 4.app    view with app open 
\dt
SELECT * FROM contracts LIMIT _

To get contracts limited to 100, we can do random 100 of each page
API request failures from overload so limited on data I can fetch
I am fetching the 100 form each month for 2015-2024 so 1200 contracts for each year - about, duplicates cause issue. Randomizing page so there is less duplicate chance
It is the first 100 contracts from the month so if it is  skewed from that sorry but im going to assume for project purposes it is not



Predict Ward amount
 Model Used: RandomForestRegressor
	•	This is a supervised machine learning model that performs regression (predicting continuous values).
	•	It is an ensemble learning method that builds multiple decision trees and averages their predictions.
	•	Random forests are robust to overfitting, work well with categorical features (after encoding), and can handle large datasets.
